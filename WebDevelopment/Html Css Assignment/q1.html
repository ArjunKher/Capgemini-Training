            <img src="q1.jpg">
            <h2 class="text-center">MS Dhoni's retirement from international cricket came as a shock to his colleagues and fans, who took to social media to pay tribute to a man who was to them variously a captain, leader, legend, mentor and friend.</h2>

             <p> "It is the end of an era," Sourav Ganguly, BCCI president, said in a statement. "His leadership qualities have been something which will be hard to match, especially in the shorter format of the game. His batting in one-day cricket in his early stages made the world stand up and notice his flair and sheer natural brilliance.</p>  
                
              <p>  "Every good thing comes to an end and this has been an absolutely brilliant one. He has set the standards for the wicket-keepers to come and make a mark for the country. He will finish with no regrets on the field. An outstanding career; I wish him the best in life."</p>
                
               <p> Virat Kohli, who took over captaincy from Dhoni, was emotional. "The world has seen achievements, I've seen the person," he wrote.</p>
            <p>Every cricketer has to end his journey one day, but still when someone you've gotten to know so closely announces that decision, you feel the emotion much more. What you've done for the country will always remain in everyone's heart......</p>
            <p>Elder brother, mentor, captain and above all a legend of the game. Learnt so much from you skipper. The game will miss you #legend</p>    
            <p>There is and will only be one MS Dhoni. Honestly, words have absolutely no depth and don’t justify what you’ve offered to India and to the world. Mahi bhai, I LOVE YOU! </p>  
            <p>From “India A” to “The India” our journey has been full of question marks, commas, blanks & exclamations. Now as you put a full stop to your chapter, I can tell u from experience that the new phase is as exciting and there’s no limit to DRS here!!! Well played</p>
            <p>Congratulations @msdhoni on a great International career. It was an honour to play alongside. Your calm demeanour and the laurels you brought as skipper will forever be remembered and cherished. Wishing you the very best.</p>
            <p>Seeing Dhoni’s journey from a small town boy into a match-winner and one of the most astute leaders the world has seen was remarkable. Thank you for the wonderful memories, Mahi. It was my privilege to play alongside you and I will always cherish the memories we shared together.</p>
